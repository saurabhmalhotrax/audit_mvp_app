# Audit MVP Application

AI-driven audit application for autonomous control testing, focusing on the 3-way match control for Accounts Payable transactions exceeding $10,000.

## Overview

This MVP demonstrates autonomous audit control testing capabilities. The application:
- Processes transaction documents (Invoice, Purchase Order, Goods Received Note)
- Performs 3-way matching validation
- Generates audit reports and evidence
- Provides structured audit trail logging

## Architecture

- **Control Testing MCP**: Core audit logic and agents
- **Documentation MCP**: Audit logging and report generation
- **Shared Utils**: Common data models and utilities
- **PostgreSQL**: Data storage for audit results
- **FastAPI**: REST API for triggering audits

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Setup

1. **Clone and navigate to the project**:
   ```bash
   cd audit_mvp_app
   ```

2. **Set up Python virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start PostgreSQL database**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d postgres
   ```

5. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   cd audit_mvp_app
   python -m uvicorn control_testing_mcp.main:app --reload
   ```

6. **Access the API**:
   - API: http://localhost:8000
   - Interactive docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Health check: http://localhost:8000/health

- [ ] Prometheus metrics export
- [ ] Structured logging to central system
- [ ] Service registry integration
- [ ] Frontend integration points

## Sample Usage

Once implemented, the API will support:

```bash
# Test a transaction against a control
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/test-control/AP_3WayMatch_10k/transaction/transaction_001"
```
